                            Continuation of Story of Zhare Book 1. From Chapter 12 to this new 
                            chapter and book.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now that the multiverse is now reset or restored, but now at the 
                            new cycle, e.g., Cycle 104.
                        </p>
                        <p>The focus of this story or chapter is on Prime 1 Earth 1.</p>
                        <p>
                            This Earth in Prime 1 is exactly like the real-world nations, 
                            history, figures of interest, etc.—all according to real-world 
                            events in the past.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (The trick here is if an Earth or Plane is near 0 or its number 
                            is quite similar or exactly the same as real-world events, no 
                            changes occur whatsoever. The Earth Prime is exactly the same as 
                            Earth 1, with the only difference being its people, their births, 
                            and such, but history-wise, everything remains accurate. You may 
                            refer to Chapter 13 of Book 1 if you need to recall things.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our focus here is on a young man who is now on the verge of 
                            success. What I mean by that is he is almost done with his 
                            studies. It took him almost seven years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, I know what you are asking: what is he studying, right? 
                            Well, he is studying Physics, Biology, and Chemistry—or should 
                            I say Biochemistry—Engineering, and, to some extent, Genetics 
                            and Robotics.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, that is indeed a lot of degrees.</p>
                        <p>
                            You might be asking, who is this guy? His name is Rafael Zack. 
                            That is his first and second name but not his last name.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (As you know, we rarely put surnames in this story, except for 
                            Barry from the previous book. We gave him the name Barry Garick.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This guy—Rafael Zack or RZ for short—is our guy for what is to 
                            come. Possibly the establishment of something greater than 
                            himself or all of the multiverse.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, the focus then shifts to Prime 1 Earth 10. Then, there was 
                            a scene of the sunrise on that Earth, e.g., Earth 10.

                    <section class="books-content">
                        <p>Then next was.</p>
                        <p>
                            Rafael Zack, or RZ, graduated years later, in about his eighth 
                            year of college or university. He graduated with honors and was 
                            awarded some amazing certificates, e.g., Best in Thesis, Best 
                            in Robotics Engineering, and lastly, Best in Genetics and Genealogy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yes, this man was gifted. People saw this as a threat, a moron, 
                            a fool, or something that was not like them. Or perhaps, it was 
                            more than just what met the eye. This was indeed not a normal 
                            thing from a real-world standpoint, but geniuses are often depicted 
                            as mad scientists.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus, RZ, or Rafael Zack, never had acquaintances or friends, 
                            but he did have the support and love of his parents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            RZ, or Rafael Zack, officially graduated in March of 2024. Yet, 
                            despite applying, he was unsuccessful in getting a job, even 
                            though he received interviews one after the other. But none were 
                            successful.
                        </p>
                        <p>But then.</p>
                        <p>After that.</p>
                        <p>Continuation of the “But then.”</p>
                        <p>
                            RZ came into contact with something—not an illegal activity or 
                            such, but more of an item rather than an actual event. He came 
                            across an item far more powerful than anything else in the universe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus, he later found out that this stone was an all-around stone—a 
                            combination of a wishing stone, the elixir of life, or something 
                            akin to the Sorcerer’s Stone (or Philosopher's Stone) from HP, and 
                            a power stone. As long as he could hold onto this stone, he would 
                            be powerful, invincible, or something beyond comprehension.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He made some wishes, and these were (to simplify them): Money, 
                            Machinery (state-of-the-art), and Protection.
                        </p>
                        <p>Context of These Wishes:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>
                                Money - <br>Not to be rich or anything, but just to be 
                                able to survive in a world where money is needed. As a wish, 
                                this money couldn’t be used by anyone unless it was given 
                                willingly by him. If not, there would be a curse upon those 
                                who tried to use it.

                                the user. It functions as both an active and passive shield. 
                                However, it does not protect against self-inflicted harm.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Thus, that is that.</p>
                        <p>Now back to the story.</p>
                        <p>Rafael Zack had been thinking:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                “What can I do with these?”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                “Can I really be this powerful?”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                “Will this stone make me immortal, like in HP (Harry Potter)?”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                “What can I do with these?”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                “Who will I become with this power?”
                            </li>
                            <li>And many other thoughts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Thus, that was it for RZ, or Rafael Zack. His own thinking was 
                            what was stopping him from achieving his own greatness.
                        </p>
                        <p>After that.</p>
                        <p>
                            RZ, or Rafael Zack’s parents (both his mother and father), were 
                            hospitalized and declared “dead on arrival.” This incident was due 
                            to a car accident.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the other hand, Rafael Zack took his parents to a funeral home 
                            and buried them. As per their wishes, RZ followed their instructions 
                            regarding the funeral, burial, and other matters, including their 
                            last will and testament.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now at home, RZ began activating one of the machines. In fact, he 
                            turned on almost all of them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            RZ started creating clones—siblings like a brother and sister—and 
                            even some of his own unique creations, such as:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>Mermaids</li>
                            <li>Centaurs</li>
                            <li>Satyrs</li>
                            <li>Minotaurs</li>
                            <li>Fauns</li>
                            <li>Werewolves</li>
                            <li>Vampires</li>
                            <li>Dragons (with the ability to transform between human and dragon form)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Thus, he continued creating more and more, equipping them with 
                            weapons for their use:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mermaids - <br>Tridents</li>
                            <li>Centaurs - <br>Spears</li>
                            <li>Satyrs & Fauns - <br>Flutes</li>
                            <li>Minotaurs - <br>Hammers</li>
                            <li>Dragons (in human form) - <br>Spears</li>
                            <li>Werewolves & Vampires - <br>No weapons</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Abilities:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>>Mermaids - <br>Water abilities</li>
                            <li>Dragons - <br>Fire abilities</li>
                            <li>
                                Centaurs, Satyrs, Fauns, and Minotaurs - <br>No special powers 
                                but naturally strong
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Thus, RZ was now preparing to build a powerful, armed, and enhanced 
                            force.
