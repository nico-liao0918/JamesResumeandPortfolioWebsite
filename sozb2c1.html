                            Continuation of Story of Zhare Book 1. From Chapter 12 to this new 
                            chapter and book.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now that the multiverse is now reset or restored, but now at the 
                            new cycle, e.g., Cycle 104.
                        </p>
                        <p>The focus of this story or chapter is on Prime 1 Earth 1.</p>
                        <p>
                            This Earth in Prime 1 is exactly like the real-world nations, 
                            history, figures of interest, etc.—all according to real-world 
                            events in the past.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (The trick here is if an Earth or Plane is near 0 or its number 
                            is quite similar or exactly the same as real-world events, no 
                            changes occur whatsoever. The Earth Prime is exactly the same as 
                            Earth 1, with the only difference being its people, their births, 
                            and such, but history-wise, everything remains accurate. You may 
                            refer to Chapter 13 of Book 1 if you need to recall things.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our focus here is on a young man who is now on the verge of 
                            success. What I mean by that is he is almost done with his 
                            studies. It took him almost seven years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, I know what you are asking: what is he studying, right? 
                            Well, he is studying Physics, Biology, and Chemistry—or should 
                            I say Biochemistry—Engineering, and, to some extent, Genetics 
                            and Robotics.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, that is indeed a lot of degrees.</p>
                        <p>
                            You might be asking, who is this guy? His name is Rafael Zack. 
                            That is his first and second name but not his last name.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (As you know, we rarely put surnames in this story, except for 
                            Barry from the previous book. We gave him the name Barry Garick.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This guy—Rafael Zack or RZ for short—is our guy for what is to 
                            come. Possibly the establishment of something greater than 
                            himself or all of the multiverse.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, the focus then shifts to Prime 1 Earth 10. Then, there was 
                            a scene of the sunrise on that Earth, e.g., Earth 10.

                    <section class="books-content">
                        <p>Then next was.</p>
                        <p>
                            Rafael Zack, or RZ, graduated years later, in about his eighth 
                            year of college or university. He graduated with honors and was 
                            awarded some amazing certificates, e.g., Best in Thesis, Best 
                            in Robotics Engineering, and lastly, Best in Genetics and Genealogy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yes, this man was gifted. People saw this as a threat, a moron, 
                            a fool, or something that was not like them. Or perhaps, it was 
                            more than just what met the eye. This was indeed not a normal 
                            thing from a real-world standpoint, but geniuses are often depicted 
                            as mad scientists.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus, RZ, or Rafael Zack, never had acquaintances or friends, 
                            but he did have the support and love of his parents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            RZ, or Rafael Zack, officially graduated in March of 2024. Yet, 
                            despite applying, he was unsuccessful in getting a job, even 
                            though he received interviews one after the other. But none were 
                            successful.
                        </p>
                        <p>But then.</p>
                        <p>After that.</p>
                        <p>Continuation of the “But then.”</p>
                        <p>
                            RZ came into contact with something—not an illegal activity or 
                            such, but more of an item rather than an actual event. He came 
                            across an item far more powerful than anything else in the universe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus, he later found out that this stone was an all-around stone—a 
                            combination of a wishing stone, the elixir of life, or something 
                            akin to the Sorcerer’s Stone (or Philosopher's Stone) from HP, and 
                            a power stone. As long as he could hold onto this stone, he would 
                            be powerful, invincible, or something beyond comprehension.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He made some wishes, and these were (to simplify them): Money, 
                            Machinery (state-of-the-art), and Protection.
                        </p>
                        <p>Context of These Wishes:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>
                                Money - <br>Not to be rich or anything, but just to be 
                                able to survive in a world where money is needed. As a wish, 
                                this money couldn’t be used by anyone unless it was given 
                                willingly by him. If not, there would be a curse upon those 
                                who tried to use it.

                                the user. It functions as both an active and passive shield. 
                                However, it does not protect against self-inflicted harm.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Thus, that is that.</p>
                        <p>Now back to the story.</p>
                        <p>Rafael Zack had been thinking:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                “What can I do with these?”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                “Can I really be this powerful?”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                “Will this stone make me immortal, like in HP (Harry Potter)?”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                “What can I do with these?”
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                “Who will I become with this power?”
                            </li>
                            <li>And many other thoughts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Thus, that was it for RZ, or Rafael Zack. His own thinking was 
                            what was stopping him from achieving his own greatness.
                        </p>
                        <p>After that.</p>
                        <p>
                            RZ, or Rafael Zack’s parents (both his mother and father), were 
                            hospitalized and declared “dead on arrival.” This incident was due 
                            to a car accident.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the other hand, Rafael Zack took his parents to a funeral home 
                            and buried them. As per their wishes, RZ followed their instructions 
                            regarding the funeral, burial, and other matters, including their 
                            last will and testament.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now at home, RZ began activating one of the machines. In fact, he 
                            turned on almost all of them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            RZ started creating clones—siblings like a brother and sister—and 
                            even some of his own unique creations, such as:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>Mermaids</li>
                            <li>Centaurs</li>
                            <li>Satyrs</li>
                            <li>Minotaurs</li>
                            <li>Fauns</li>
                            <li>Werewolves</li>
                            <li>Vampires</li>
                            <li>Dragons (with the ability to transform between human and dragon form)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Thus, he continued creating more and more, equipping them with 
                            weapons for their use:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mermaids - <br>Tridents</li>
                            <li>Centaurs - <br>Spears</li>
                            <li>Satyrs & Fauns - <br>Flutes</li>
                            <li>Minotaurs - <br>Hammers</li>
                            <li>Dragons (in human form) - <br>Spears</li>
                            <li>Werewolves & Vampires - <br>No weapons</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Abilities:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>>Mermaids - <br>Water abilities</li>
                            <li>Dragons - <br>Fire abilities</li>
                            <li>
                                Centaurs, Satyrs, Fauns, and Minotaurs - <br>No special powers 
                                but naturally strong
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Thus, RZ was now preparing to build a powerful, armed, and enhanced 
                            force.

                    <section class="books-content">
                        <p>After that.</p>
                        <p>
                            Rafael Zack had now managed to buy an island in the Philippines. 
                            (Also, RZ lives in the Philippines—I may have forgotten to mention 
                            that.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This island is off the coast of Palawan, near the contested waters 
                            but still owned by the Philippines. However, this island is not a 
                            natural landmass. It is St. Thomas Shoal, and the ship aground 
                            there was purchased by RZ from the Philippine government.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Centaurs, Satyrs, Fauns, Werewolves, Vampires, and Minotaurs 
                            had now suited up, allowing them to appear as if they were walking 
                            or running on water. Their suits had several advanced features, 
                            including the ability to walk on water, holster weapons, and much 
                            more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Meanwhile, the Mermaids had waterproof suits capable of withstanding 
                            underwater pressure, similar to the diving suits in the game 
                            Subnautica. However, these suits had everything they needed—
                            protection from extreme cold and heat, weapon holsters, and 
                            additional enhancements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Dragons could simply transform into their dragon form, but 
                            in human form, they also had specialized suits similar to the 
                            rest of RZ’s creations.
                        </p>
                        <p>These creations were not like traditional mythical creatures:</p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>
                                Mermaids - <br>Unlike traditional mermaids, they did not have 
                                tails.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Werewolves - <br>They had no traditional weaknesses but were 
                                giant wolves or wolf-like creatures, similar to those in 
                                Twilight.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Vampires - <br>They also had no weaknesses but needed to feed 
                                on blood. However, they could control their thirst and function 
                                normally.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The other species retained their traditional appearances and 
                            abilities:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>Minotaurs - <br>Half-bull, half-human.</li>
                            <li>Satyrs & Fauns - <br>Half-goat, half-human.</li>
                            <li>
                                Dragonkind - <br>Humans with the ability to transform into 
                                dragons.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The Dragons were depicted much like those in classical dragon-
                            slaying myths—massive, four-legged creatures with full wings 
                            and the ability to breathe fire.
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus, that is how RZ, or Rafael Zack, accomplished these things.</p>
                        <p>After that.</p>
                        <p>
                            Rafael Zack gave a command to his Mermaids to stay in the waters 
                            near the “island,” while the rest remained on the “island,” awaiting 
                            further orders from RZ.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Suddenly, the Mermaids spotted something unusual and reported back 
                            to RZ.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Ellie, Queen of Mermaids</strong>, 
                            "Sir Rafael, we spotted a ship, but it does not belong to any of 
                            the nearby nations. It has some kind of unfamiliar characters or 
                            script. We also took a picture of it."
                        </p>
                        <p>Ellie handed over the camera to RZ.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>RZ</strong>, 
                            "Thank you, Ellie."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            RZ examined the picture and immediately recognized the characters—
                            it contained Chinese script. The Chinese navy had been spotted 
                            somewhere near the 12 NM boundary of St. Thomas Shoal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Without hesitation, RZ ordered Ellie to use force if the ship 
                            crossed within 10 NM of the island or St. Thomas Shoal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (<em>For those who may not know, NM stands for Nautical Miles. This 
                                is just for informational purposes, not to imply that readers 
                                are unaware.</em>)
                            </p>
                        <p>
                            Meanwhile, on the "island," RZ set up the first-ever Mini Factories 
                            (a shorthand for "Miniaturized Factories," item number 6 from the 
                            Pre-Fab Inventions list). These factories immediately began mass-
                            producing essential resources, including food, water, firearms, 
                            ammunition, shells, and other supplies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus, that was what RZ did following the sighting of the incoming 
                            Chinese vessel.
                        </p>

                    <section class="books-content">
                        <p>After that.</p>
                        <p>
                            Rafael Zack issued a warning to the incoming Chinese vessel with 
                            this message:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Rafael Zack</strong>,
                            "Greetings, China Ship,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am Rafael Zack of St. Thomas Shoal Island, formerly of the 
                            Philippines.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, this is no longer their domain.</p>
                        <p>It is mine.</p>
                        <p>Please do not enter my territorial waters, or else.</p>
                        <p>
                            Regards,
                            Rafael Zack."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Chinese vessel did not respond yet, but it continued its 
                            approach toward the "island."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Mermaids were positioned at the 10 NM boundary from the 
                            island's radius, fully prepared for any confrontation.
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus far.</p>

                        <p>After that.</p>
                        <p>
                            Rafael Zack saw through his binoculars that the ship had now 
                            entered the 10 NM (Nautical Miles) boundary. He immediately 
                            radioed Ellie and her Mermaids to attack.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is how it went.</p>
                        <p>
                            Ellie and her Mermaids peeked out of the water, their eyes just 
                            inches above the surface, and saw the ship approaching fast. As 
                            it passed, Ellie used her water abilities to freeze the rudder 
                            and propeller, rendering them immobile. At the same time, one 
                            of Ellie’s Mermaids summoned powerful waves, crashing them into 
                            the vessel. A giant wave, as large as the ship’s hull, struck 
                            the vessel before receding into the ocean. Another wave followed. 
                            The Chinese crew noticed the abnormality—there was no storm or 
                            any natural cause for such massive waves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then, later on, Ellie and her Mermaids, armed with spears and 
                            tridents, commenced boarding the ship from its hull and 
                            upper decks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They created a whirlpool that lifted them up to the ship’s upper 
                            decks, making their presence visible. Using their abilities, 
                            they forced the bodies of the Chinese crew to stop moving. 
                            The Mermaids manipulated the water within their bodies, 
                            rendering them paralyzed. The soldiers, unable to resist, 
                            were left defenseless as the Mermaids unholstered their weapons, 
                            aimed at their heads, and pulled the trigger.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Chinese soldiers were dead.</p>
                        <p>
                            Moving throughout the ship, the Mermaids repeated the process 
                            until only a few remained in the Captain’s Deck or Bridge. 
                            They then forced the remaining crew, including the captain, 
                            to steer the ship away from St. Thomas Shoal. Once the task 
                            was complete, the Mermaids returned to the deck, dove into 
                            the ocean, and disappeared without a trace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Chinese vessel was now 15 NM away from the island, officially 
                            out of St. Thomas Shoal.

                            Now, RZ or Rafael Zack had succeeded in defending his own 
                            territories.

                            China immediately pressured the Philippines to take action 
                            against what they considered a declaration of war. However, 
                            before any official response could be made, RZ broadcasted 
                            a live message across every screen, radio, and audio-visual 
                            device worldwide.

                            <strong>Rafael Zack</strong>, 
                            "Greetings, world leaders. I am Rafael Zack of the Philippines. 
                            I have bought this island, St. Thomas Shoal, for a reason you 
                            leaders refuse to acknowledge as the truth."

                            the recent events—China’s intrusion and the counterattack.)

                            "This victory over China proves that nations can stand up against 
                            a superpower. You can stand and defend your ground!"

                        <p>
                            "But all you do is wait and talk, as if talking alone solves 
                            problems. You must act upon your words; only then will you not be 
                            liars and frauds."

                        <p>
                            "This is my island now. However, I will keep the Philippine flag 
                            with me as a sign of my homeland."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Now, if I ever decide to wage war against you, China, I will do 
                            everything in my power to defeat you."
