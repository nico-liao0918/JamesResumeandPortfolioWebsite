                        <p>Introduction</p>
                        <p>
                            The Brethren is established as an organization. 
                            A secretive organization. Unknown to the World.

                            <li>Centaria</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            "gave birth" means to create life. 
                            All of this was possible because of the Genesis Chambers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then all of the Kingdoms and Brethren Convened and Kingdoms asked 
                            the Brethren that they want a leader for all of them 
                            (us, the Kingdoms).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So in terms, they all discussed all the needed things.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am James (a character in the story), Leader of the Brethren. 
                            And all the kingdoms wanted a new governing body, 
                            thus the nation of Imperial Republic of Zhare was "born". 
                            "born" created by the Kingdoms and Brethren. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But not all of the kingdoms want to be part of a single nation. 
                            They wanted to be independent. 
                            Thus, Kingdom number 1-5 are part of the Imperial Republic of Zhare, 
                            Kingdom number 6-19 are not.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So in terms, The Brethren became the Father of Nations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And also the Brethren invented wands for themselves, 
                            but unlike in Harry potter and fantastic beast, 
                            these wands don't need to be descendants of wizards and witches. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The brethren's wands have a defense, offense, forget, and 
                            protect spells.
                            defense spells like Azor (adaptation from harry potter and 
                            fantastic beast, 
                            but not exactly the same), Offensive spells like Razo 
                            (again adaptation from harry potter and fantastic beast, 
                            but not exactly the same) forget spell like Obliviate or 
                            here in Brethren is called Zaso, and protect spells like Asako. 
                            And sometimes even heal spell like Haroz. a Sleep spell called 
                            Nanor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each spell can only target one person at a time of casting the 
                            spell.
                            The Nanor spell can last about 10 hours. 
                            I know that may be long but believe me, 
                            when I say that sleeping that long can be a benefit especially 
                            to the Brethren spies or agents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Hazor spell can cause any kinds of wounds, scars, 
                            and broken bones, and any such need for healing, 
                            without the need of operations from a surgeon or 
                            medicine usage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Asako is for spells for its items, 
                            it can be used in items, enchanting them, and on a 
                            person's skin. making them seem impervious to bullets 
                            or weapons, for 24 hours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Zaso spell can erase all memories, or 
                            only the events that took place when the 
                            Brethren were there. effective immediately. 
                            It affects the user as well, meaning they can 
                            see the memories of the target so the agents know what 
                            to delete if they want it to be precise, if restraint is 
                            not a problem, they can erase the whole memory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Razo spell is true, an energy blast capable of immobilizing 
                            or 
                            freezing a target and it can give potential shocks when used 
                            aggressively, like tone of voice if casting a spell is verbal or 
                            just in the mind, and a calm voice either verbal or in the mind. 
                            A calm voice means immobilization or freezing, while a harsh 
                            tone and like an angry tone is a shock like a tazer. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now lastly the azor spell, yes so and so, nothing new. 
                            But the duration of these spells is 11 hours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The sleep spell, Nanor can last 10 hours. 
                            Trust me it is very effective.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The thing about casting a spell:
                        </p>
                        <ol class="list">
                            <li>
                                It can be either verbal or mental. 
                                So a user needs complete concentration in casting.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                So if the user casts a spell and 
                                he is not holding a want, the spell doesn't work. 
                                But in some events that wireless casting is allowed 
                                if someone else is holding the wand other than the user, 
                                therefore wireless casting is allowed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A user needs to hold the wand to cast a spell.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The wands are bound to the first user it touches and 
                                binds them together. psychic or mental boundness, 
                                so if it's lost or not in a holster, it can be found by the 
                                user bound to that wand. 
                                It kinda sends like a Homing Beacon to the User
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            And that's all.
                            So yeah. They invented such a wand.
                        </p>

                            The Kingdoms is then transferred to the Imperial Republic of Zhare 
                            or IROZ or Zhare. And the Kingdoms wanted James to be King 
                            over Zhare, 
                            so the Brethren was left with no leader, and James assigned a new 
                            leader for the Brethren.

                            The Kingdoms, and Zhare, and Brethren are established in the 
                            Philippines. Hidden from the Philippines. This did not stop the 
                            Kingdoms into attacking all or any lands for the purpose of 
                            illegal activities that are land and city or rural areas, as 
                            long as it is near the Kingdoms. They would conquer them with ease.

                        <p>
                            Zhare commanded each of the Kingdoms Legions with Kingdom's

                            Then it got the attention of the Philippine President. But did not 
                            do anything just yet.
                            And Zhare continued its conquest. 
                            Until Each of the Kingdoms and Zhare itself have lands of their own.

                            its conquest. Until Each of the Kingdoms and Zhare itself 
                            have lands of their own.

                            Then, finally, the President of the Philippines 
                            decided to go to the King of Zhare directly, and discuss.

                            <strong>PH President said</strong>, 
                            "Hi, I noticed that you have taken this and others into 
                            your territory. What is your intention for these lands?"
                        </p>

                            <strong>King of Zhare</strong>,
                            "Hi, yes. Good you noticed. Now if you’re asking me. 
                            I intend to use this for the defence of our shared territory—the 
                            Philippines of course. As I plan to reach the ocean and set up 
                            my navy and airforce and even coast guard."

                            <strong>PH President</strong>,
                            "Ahh, that is very ambitious even for you. Even if you 
                            tried. You won’t take it even without a fight as there 
                            are no lands for you."

                            <strong>PH President</strong>,
                            "Kingdoms? Isn’t that your lands?"

                        <p>
                            <strong>King of Zhare</strong>,
                            "No. This is my lands. If I ever reach a sea border. 
                            You will be amazed at what we can do."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>PH President</strong>,
                            "How so?"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>King of Zhare</strong>,

                            So thus, the President of the Philippines left 
                            Zharian territory and left something in the 
                            house of the King. A piece of paper.

                            That is what I read in the document

                            So, right. This is what happens next in 
                            the events of this scenario.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the said dialogue. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Zhare immediately got to work as to 
                            getting to the ocean. More and more lands 
                            were indeed acquired in terms of either bought, 
                            conquered from illegal activities or a potential 
                            illegal activity. Months later. Zhare has now 
                            reached the ocean. Together with the Brethren, 
                            all Kingdoms have also reached the oceans. 
                            Now they are building shipyards and airstrips 
                            and hangars/construction yards for aircraft and such. 
                            And everything it entails in a military manner. 
                            And yes. There is one time that a law enforcement officer 
                            has pulled them over for a certain violation in traffic laws. 
                            But when they did show the signature and seal of the 
                            President of the Philippines and the said treaty to the 
                            said officer. They were let go. A few weeks later after 
                            the construction of the shipyard and airstrip and hangars. 
                            They started to build their units. And have set off their 
                            ships, air force in the air into the ocean for ships and 
                            in the air for their aircrafts. Ships are destroyer class 
                            and frigate class. Fighter jets for aircraft and troop 
                            carriers for transport.

                        <p>
                            Let me add some more details and 
                            context in this scenario.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the second meeting of the King and 
                            President of the Philippines. And the 
                            invitation to the UN is drawing near. 
                            The 2 leaders are now preparing to leave 
                            for the UN in about 4 days time. After 4 days. 
                            The UN event is here. The two leaders came 
                            into the venue dressed in formal attire. 
                            And was shown their seats at a table. 
                            The table in which Zhare and Philippines was 
                            seated was with the USA, Japan, S. Korea and 
                            Israel. And yes. It is a 7 seater table. 
                            The last nation to come in was Britain 
                            at the table. Later on. The host of the event 
                            has an announcement. 
                            To hold UN-like sessions in the Conference 
                            Room 135. In this context. I don’t know if 
                            that room exists in real life. 
                            But let’s say it did. This room is 
                            for global matters on global warming, 
                            economics strife, poverty, energy, 
                            piracy, and many more. So now all the 
                            nations got to their seats and all guests 
                            were seated far away but not that far not to 
                            see what was happening. Zhare was seated along 
                            with these other guests.

                            of their planned mock battle. The 
                            discussion proceeded as follows:
