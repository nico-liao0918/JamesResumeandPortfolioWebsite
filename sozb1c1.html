                        <p>Introduction</p>
                        <p>
                            The Brethren is established as an organization. 
                            A secretive organization. Unknown to the World.

                            <li>Centaria</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            "gave birth" means to create life. 
                            All of this was possible because of the Genesis Chambers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then all of the Kingdoms and Brethren Convened and Kingdoms asked 
                            the Brethren that they want a leader for all of them 
                            (us, the Kingdoms).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So in terms, they all discussed all the needed things.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am James (a character in the story), Leader of the Brethren. 
                            And all the kingdoms wanted a new governing body, 
                            thus the nation of Imperial Republic of Zhare was "born". 
                            "born" created by the Kingdoms and Brethren. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But not all of the kingdoms want to be part of a single nation. 
                            They wanted to be independent. 
                            Thus, Kingdom number 1-5 are part of the Imperial Republic of Zhare, 
                            Kingdom number 6-19 are not.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So in terms, The Brethren became the Father of Nations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And also the Brethren invented wands for themselves, 
                            but unlike in Harry potter and fantastic beast, 
                            these wands don't need to be descendants of wizards and witches. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The brethren's wands have a defense, offense, forget, and 
                            protect spells.
                            defense spells like Azor (adaptation from harry potter and 
                            fantastic beast, 
                            but not exactly the same), Offensive spells like Razo 
                            (again adaptation from harry potter and fantastic beast, 
                            but not exactly the same) forget spell like Obliviate or 
                            here in Brethren is called Zaso, and protect spells like Asako. 
                            And sometimes even heal spell like Haroz. a Sleep spell called 
                            Nanor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each spell can only target one person at a time of casting the 
                            spell.
                            The Nanor spell can last about 10 hours. 
                            I know that may be long but believe me, 
                            when I say that sleeping that long can be a benefit especially 
                            to the Brethren spies or agents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Hazor spell can cause any kinds of wounds, scars, 
                            and broken bones, and any such need for healing, 
                            without the need of operations from a surgeon or 
                            medicine usage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Asako is for spells for its items, 
                            it can be used in items, enchanting them, and on a 
                            person's skin. making them seem impervious to bullets 
                            or weapons, for 24 hours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Zaso spell can erase all memories, or 
                            only the events that took place when the 
                            Brethren were there. effective immediately. 
                            It affects the user as well, meaning they can 
                            see the memories of the target so the agents know what 
                            to delete if they want it to be precise, if restraint is 
                            not a problem, they can erase the whole memory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Razo spell is true, an energy blast capable of immobilizing 
                            or 
                            freezing a target and it can give potential shocks when used 
                            aggressively, like tone of voice if casting a spell is verbal or 
                            just in the mind, and a calm voice either verbal or in the mind. 
                            A calm voice means immobilization or freezing, while a harsh 
                            tone and like an angry tone is a shock like a tazer. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now lastly the azor spell, yes so and so, nothing new. 
                            But the duration of these spells is 11 hours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The sleep spell, Nanor can last 10 hours. 
                            Trust me it is very effective.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The thing about casting a spell:
                        </p>
                        <ol class="list">
                            <li>
                                It can be either verbal or mental. 
                                So a user needs complete concentration in casting.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                So if the user casts a spell and 
                                he is not holding a want, the spell doesn't work. 
                                But in some events that wireless casting is allowed 
                                if someone else is holding the wand other than the user, 
                                therefore wireless casting is allowed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A user needs to hold the wand to cast a spell.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The wands are bound to the first user it touches and 
                                binds them together. psychic or mental boundness, 
                                so if it's lost or not in a holster, it can be found by the 
                                user bound to that wand. 
                                It kinda sends like a Homing Beacon to the User
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            And that's all.
                            So yeah. They invented such a wand.
                        </p>

                            The Kingdoms is then transferred to the Imperial Republic of Zhare 
                            or IROZ or Zhare. And the Kingdoms wanted James to be King 
                            over Zhare, 
                            so the Brethren was left with no leader, and James assigned a new 
                            leader for the Brethren.

                            The Kingdoms, and Zhare, and Brethren are established in the 
                            Philippines. Hidden from the Philippines. This did not stop the 
                            Kingdoms into attacking all or any lands for the purpose of 
                            illegal activities that are land and city or rural areas, as 
                            long as it is near the Kingdoms. They would conquer them with ease.

                        <p>
                            Zhare commanded each of the Kingdoms Legions with Kingdom's

                            Then it got the attention of the Philippine President. But did not 
                            do anything just yet.
                            And Zhare continued its conquest. 
                            Until Each of the Kingdoms and Zhare itself have lands of their own.

                            its conquest. Until Each of the Kingdoms and Zhare itself 
                            have lands of their own.

                            Then, finally, the President of the Philippines 
                            decided to go to the King of Zhare directly, and discuss.

                            <strong>PH President said</strong>, 
                            "Hi, I noticed that you have taken this and others into 
                            your territory. What is your intention for these lands?"
                        </p>

                            <strong>King of Zhare</strong>,
                            "Hi, yes. Good you noticed. Now if you’re asking me. 
                            I intend to use this for the defence of our shared territory—the 
                            Philippines of course. As I plan to reach the ocean and set up 
                            my navy and airforce and even coast guard."

                            <strong>PH President</strong>,
                            "Ahh, that is very ambitious even for you. Even if you 
                            tried. You won’t take it even without a fight as there 
                            are no lands for you."

                            <strong>PH President</strong>,
                            "Kingdoms? Isn’t that your lands?"

                        <p>
                            <strong>King of Zhare</strong>,
                            "No. This is my lands. If I ever reach a sea border. 
                            You will be amazed at what we can do."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>PH President</strong>,
                            "How so?"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>King of Zhare</strong>,

                            So thus, the President of the Philippines left 
                            Zharian territory and left something in the 
                            house of the King. A piece of paper.

                            That is what I read in the document

                            So, right. This is what happens next in 
                            the events of this scenario.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the said dialogue. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Zhare immediately got to work as to 
                            getting to the ocean. More and more lands 
                            were indeed acquired in terms of either bought, 
                            conquered from illegal activities or a potential 
                            illegal activity. Months later. Zhare has now 
                            reached the ocean. Together with the Brethren, 
                            all Kingdoms have also reached the oceans. 
                            Now they are building shipyards and airstrips 
                            and hangars/construction yards for aircraft and such. 
                            And everything it entails in a military manner. 
                            And yes. There is one time that a law enforcement officer 
                            has pulled them over for a certain violation in traffic laws. 
                            But when they did show the signature and seal of the 
                            President of the Philippines and the said treaty to the 
                            said officer. They were let go. A few weeks later after 
                            the construction of the shipyard and airstrip and hangars. 
                            They started to build their units. And have set off their 
                            ships, air force in the air into the ocean for ships and 
                            in the air for their aircrafts. Ships are destroyer class 
                            and frigate class. Fighter jets for aircraft and troop 
                            carriers for transport.

                        <p>
                            Let me add some more details and 
                            context in this scenario.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the second meeting of the King and 
                            President of the Philippines. And the 
                            invitation to the UN is drawing near. 
                            The 2 leaders are now preparing to leave 
                            for the UN in about 4 days time. After 4 days. 
                            The UN event is here. The two leaders came 
                            into the venue dressed in formal attire. 
                            And was shown their seats at a table. 
                            The table in which Zhare and Philippines was 
                            seated was with the USA, Japan, S. Korea and 
                            Israel. And yes. It is a 7 seater table. 
                            The last nation to come in was Britain 
                            at the table. Later on. The host of the event 
                            has an announcement. 
                            To hold UN-like sessions in the Conference 
                            Room 135. In this context. I don’t know if 
                            that room exists in real life. 
                            But let’s say it did. This room is 
                            for global matters on global warming, 
                            economics strife, poverty, energy, 
                            piracy, and many more. So now all the 
                            nations got to their seats and all guests 
                            were seated far away but not that far not to 
                            see what was happening. Zhare was seated along 
                            with these other guests.

                            arrived at the hotel, where they 
                            met with Britain to finalize the details 
                            of their planned mock battle. The 
                            discussion proceeded as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ol class="list">
                            <li>
                                Participants – The battle would involve both nations: 
                                Britain and Zhare.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Weaponry – Only medieval weaponry would be 
                                allowed at all times.
                            </li>

                                Restrictions – No guns, no ammunition, 
                                no modern weaponry of any kind.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Battlefield Location – Britain had communicated with 
                                Canada to use some designated areas within Canada 
                                as the battlefield.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Logistics – All transportation costs would be covered 
                                by Britain.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Spoils of War – There would be rewards for the victor.

                                Winning, Losing, and Stalemate Criteria:

                                    Winning Condition – If 10% of the 
                                    allocated army is "down," that nation wins.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Losing Condition – If 90% of a nation’s 
                                    army is "down," they are defeated.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Stalemate Condition – If both armies sustain equal losses.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                Troop Allocation – A total of approximately 2
                                5,000 soldiers would participate in the battle.
                            </li>

                        <p>
                            These arrangements were settled over the course of about four days.

                            Right, so the spoils of war in this case are not monetary. Instead, 
                            the victor earns the right to draft an agreement, much like how 
                            the Philippines and Zhare did with their Philippines-Rising Nation 
                            Treaty.

                            Additionally, the mock battle is set to take place in 10 days. 
                            To prepare for this, British ships will arrive in the Philippines 
                            in 9 days to pick up the soldiers participating in the battle as 
                            well as the Philippine delegation who will be attending as 
                            witnesses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The British ship will:

                                Arrive in the Philippines on the 9th day.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Depart at the end of that day.

                            <li>
                                Reach Canada the next day, just in time for the battle.

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            This event marks a new aspect of diplomacy, where nations 
                            engage in a controlled military exercise to settle agreements.

                            The Mock Battle:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the Philippines, Zhare, and Canadian delegations 
                            arrived at the designated time and location, the announcers 
                            began by outlining the rules:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Only medieval weaponry would be used.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                No guns, ammunition, or modern weapons were allowed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Soldiers would be considered "down" if they were 
                                touched by a wooden sword or spear.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Winning, losing, and stalemate conditions were clearly defined
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In the event of a stalemate, a second round would be conducted.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Both teams were given five minutes to set up their camps and 
                            strategic positions within the five-hectare battlefield. 
                            Spectators, equipped with cameras and drones, were ready to 
                            observe the battle with neutrality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the end of the prep time, an announcement signaled 
                            the battle’s imminent start. In a scene reminiscent 
                            of Squid Game, the legions (Zhare, Brethren, and the Kingdoms) 
                            and battalions (British forces) stood at the ready. With the 
                            sound of a starting gun, the legions swiftly moved to secure 
                            key locations, while the battalions initially remained stationed 
                            at their main camp.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Upon receiving orders from their generals, the battalions advanced 
                            but were repelled by the heavily fortified positions of the legions. 
                            This resulted in minimal casualties for the legions, who won the 
                            first engagements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As time passed, the legions at their main camp pushed forward, 
                            capturing strategic points. Some legions launched a direct 
                            assault on the battalion's main camp, while others secured flags 
                            at key locations before returning to reinforce the main attack.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the battle raged on, it became clear that victory belonged 
                            to the legions. Critics compared the Zharian battle strategy 
                            to the Roman conquest of Gaul, while others disagreed. 
                            However, most military experts present acknowledged its 
                            Roman-style combat tactics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By the end of the battle:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                90% of the British battalions were eliminated.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The legions remained at full strength.

                            <li>
                                The victory was decisively awarded to Zhare's Legions.

                            Following the mock battle, Zharian ships arrived at 
                            the Canadian borders, accompanied by fighter jets soaring 
                            through Canadian airspace. Massive transport ships—some 
                            appearing to have anti-gravity modules—descended near the 
                            battlefield. These airborne vessels demonstrated Zhare’s 
                            technological advancements, leading many to compare them 
                            to the Type 3 Interstellar Civilization on the Kardashev 
                            scale.

                                Capable of rapid deployment.

                            <li>
                                Independently transporting its forces.

                                Not reliant on British military ships for the 
                                return journey.

                            Each transport ship carried soldiers back to 
                            their respective Kingdoms:

                                Mecka Legion returned to Mecka Kingdom.

                                Other legions were similarly transported to their 
                                homelands.

                        <p>
                            Meanwhile, another Zharian transport ship was dispatched 
                            to Canada to retrieve the Philippine delegation, 
                            bringing them home via a landing at Malacañang Palace.

                        <p>
                            This display of Zhare’s military and logistical capabilities 
                            sent a strong message to the world—that Zhare was ready to 
                            defend its interests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In celebration, Zhare’s air force launched flares and 
                            fireworks, while its navy—including destroyers, frigates, 
                            and coast guard ships—fired missiles into the sky, detonating 
                            them as a symbolic victory display.

                            back via military ships, Zharian vessels had already arrived 
                            independently, even navigating the Panama Canal effortlessly

                                Zharian transport ships were airborne—akin to cargo 
                                planes but vastly more advanced.

                                Zharian naval ships (destroyers, frigates, 
                                and coast guards) remained on water
                            </li>

                                air force.

                        <p>
                            This mock battle and its aftermath solidified Zhare’s 
                            growing influence, proving that even a micronation 
                            could stand as a global force when properly equipped 
                            and led.

                            Palace. Upon arrival, they were warmly welcomed by 
                            Japanese officials. The formal discussion was scheduled 
                            for the following day, and in the meantime, the Zharian 
                            delegation was provided with accommodations, meals, and 
                            free time to explore the city.

                            "As the victors, what is it that you seek in this agreement?"

                        <p>
                            <strong>Zhare</strong>,
                            "We want a military alliance and access to blueprints for

                            "Yes, but our ships are still in the medieval stage—
                            though they are made of steel, they lack modern weaponry 
                            such as guns, turrets, or cannons."

                            "Ah, I see. That makes sense. I’ll provide you with 
                            blueprints that will help modernize your armed forces."
