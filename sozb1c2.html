                        <p>Continuation of Chapter 1.</p>
                        <p>In Zhare’s Capital;</p>
                        <p>
                            Both Huete and Noran set aside their differences and now join 
                            forces against this multiversal threat from Earth 666 and 879. 
                            King Noran of Dartha and King Huete of Hassar readied their 
                            standing troops in the hangar of Zhare’s capital city—Solace, 
                            which is technically in the Philippines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, the Philippines attacked Zhare across all its territories 
                            but were forced to retreat due to massive missile bombardments 
                            and artillery fire on Philippine forces. The President of the 
                            Philippines then asked Zhare for a ceasefire but was ignored. 
                            The King of Zhare commanded his forces—legions—to attack the P
                            hilippine forces. The Zharian forces emerged victorious in battle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Philippines were forced to surrender and lay down their arms, 
                            thus waving the white flag. The President issued a plea for peace 
                            against Zhare, and Zhare responded with this statement:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>King of Zhare</strong>, 
                            "Greetings, brethren in the Philippines, You have declared war 
                            against me but were unsuccessful in defeating us. This is 
                            just the strength of the Inner Kingdoms and not the entire 
                            Alliance and Coalition of Allied Earths.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I accept your surrender. But you shall be enslaved by us. 
                            As for you, Sulu Sultanate, I shall return to you Palawan and 
                            the ARMM Region of the Philippines. I see that you will indeed 
                            play a role in the future with us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hope that you, Sulu Sultanate, will help us in the far or 
                            near future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And we shall help you whenever you, Sulu Sultanate, need it.

                            And thus, the Philippines and Sulu responded with agreement. 
                            The treaty was signed for peace.

                            End of discussion.

                        <p>
                            Now, on Earth 1, the satellites of the ArcNet began to boot up, 
                            now covering most parts of the world. They engaged their plasma 
                            railguns and plasma shields in preparation for danger approaching 
                            from outer space. A Fargone ship was now inbound. Remember what 
                            a Fargone is? Yes, a space-faring airship, according to Zharian 
                            terminology.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The satellites fully engaged their shields and weaponry. The 
                            Fargone ships had now entered Earth's outer orbit. Their origin 
                            and intent were unknown, but the satellites were in place as a 
                            deterrent. Zharian spaceships and the Fargone ships had now 
                            entered the area of interest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Zharian Fargone ship opened a channel and said;

                        <p>
                            The unknown Fargone ship replied,

                            <strong>Chief of the Dar</strong>, 
                            "We don't come here to make war. We come in peace. We are the 
                            people of Navi from Pandora in Alpha Centauri. Please

                            to fight off. Please help? I implore you to come to Pandora."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Admiral Zod</strong>, 
                            "We will in due time. Please land in our capital for food, 
                            water, and fuel. We also implore you to rest up before our 
                            journey to Pandora."

                            and it did. The Pandoran Fargone ships have now safely landed 
                            on Zharian soil and are now under negotiations, possibly for 
                            technological and military agreements.

                        <p>T
                            he enemy, whom we will denote as Nova (not in terms of Marvel, 
                            but still), has now taken control of most parts of Pandora and 
                            is mining its resources, including its valuable Fargone 
                            shipbuilding facilities. The Nova Nation comes from another 
                            planet within the same solar system as Pandora. They invaded 
                            Pandora for its resources and workforce, intending to plunder 
                            and exploit the planet for their own shipbuilding needs.

                        <p>
                            More and more ships are seen moving inbound and outbound between 
                            Nova and Pandora.

                        <p>
                            The Fargone ships are now almost complete, with a total of 
                            300 Fargone ships constructed and nearly ready for launch. 
                            The Navi and Zhare have negotiated further expansion and base-
                            building agreements, similar to the VFA agreement between the 
                            Philippines and America—only this time, between the Navi and 
                            Zhare.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Zhare has now ordered the launch of its Fargone ships into 
                            the air and space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As Zhare is now fully prepared, all Fargone ships are airborne 
                            and in space, ready to jump to Pandora.

                            As they entered Pandora's space, each of the 300 and 1 Fargone 
                            ships joined the fray.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Nova Fargone ships had secured Pandora's space and now 
                            engaged their weapons, warning the incoming Fargone ships to 
                            stay away or face destruction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the Navi Fargone ships and the Zharian Fargone ships replied,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Admiral Zod</strong>, 
                            "This is Admiral Zod of the Zharian Nation. Stand down, Nova, 
                            or we will open fire."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Chieftain Naiivatu</strong>, 
                            "You have taken our homes. Now we fight for it. All Navi, 
                            let us take back our homes!"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On Pandora, all Navi had been gearing up and were now fighting 
                            the Nova forces on the planet, while the Zharian and Navi Fargone 
                            ships engaged the Nova fleet in space. Weapons were fired, and 
                            the battle erupted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A Navi Fargone ship was damaged in the fight but managed to 
                            retreat. Zhare, on the other hand, not only defeated a single 
                            Nova Fargone ship but destroyed approximately 135 enemy Fargone 
                            ships in battle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the ground level, the Navi forces were fighting fiercely, 
                            with explosions erupting throughout the battlefield. The battle 
                            raged on and on until the final Nova Fargone ships fled Pandora's 
                            space, declaring,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Nova Forces</strong>, 
                            "This is not over. We will return stronger!"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And with that, they left Pandora's space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Though the war had been won, uncertainty loomed over future 
                            invasions that might come. The Navi Fargone ships and two Zharian 
                            Fargone ships landed in Iviaana, the capital city of the Navi 
                            on Pandora.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Pandorans spoke, "Zhare, thank you for helping us. We 
                            welcome you to our planet."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Zhare</strong>, 
                            "Thank you for your hospitality. We will leave a few ships in 
                            your space so that no one will ever invade you again."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Pandora</strong>, 
                            "Thank you."</p>
                        <p>
                            Zhare boarded their ships and departed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Zharian Fargone ships also left Pandora's space, but 20 
                            Fargone ships remained behind to protect Pandora under the 
                            leadership of Admiral Karin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They opened a portal and left, now heading back to Earth.
