                        <h2>Chapter 2: Greatest Conquerors</h2>
                        <p>Continuation of Chapter 1.</p>
                        <p>In Zhare’s Capital;</p>
                        <p>
                            Both Huete and Noran set aside their differences and now join 
                            forces against this multiversal threat from Earth 666 and 879. 
                            King Noran of Dartha and King Huete of Hassar readied their 
                            standing troops in the hangar of Zhare’s capital city—Solace, 
                            which is technically in the Philippines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, the Philippines attacked Zhare across all its territories 
                            but were forced to retreat due to massive missile bombardments 
                            and artillery fire on Philippine forces. The President of the 
                            Philippines then asked Zhare for a ceasefire but was ignored. 
                            The King of Zhare commanded his forces—legions—to attack the P
                            hilippine forces. The Zharian forces emerged victorious in battle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Philippines were forced to surrender and lay down their arms, 
                            thus waving the white flag. The President issued a plea for peace 
                            against Zhare, and Zhare responded with this statement:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>King of Zhare</strong>, 
                            "Greetings, brethren in the Philippines, You have declared war 
                            against me but were unsuccessful in defeating us. This is 
                            just the strength of the Inner Kingdoms and not the entire 
                            Alliance and Coalition of Allied Earths.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I accept your surrender. But you shall be enslaved by us. 
                            As for you, Sulu Sultanate, I shall return to you Palawan and 
                            the ARMM Region of the Philippines. I see that you will indeed 
                            play a role in the future with us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hope that you, Sulu Sultanate, will help us in the far or 
                            near future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And we shall help you whenever you, Sulu Sultanate, need it.

                            And thus, the Philippines and Sulu responded with agreement. 
                            The treaty was signed for peace.

                        <p>
                            Now, on Earth 1, the satellites of the ArcNet began to boot up, 
                            now covering most parts of the world. They engaged their plasma 
                            railguns and plasma shields in preparation for danger approaching 
                            from outer space. A Fargone ship was now inbound. Remember what 
                            a Fargone is? Yes, a space-faring airship, according to Zharian 
                            terminology.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The satellites fully engaged their shields and weaponry. The 
                            Fargone ships had now entered Earth's outer orbit. Their origin 
                            and intent were unknown, but the satellites were in place as a 
                            deterrent. Zharian spaceships and the Fargone ships had now 
                            entered the area of interest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Zharian Fargone ship opened a channel and said;

                        <p>
                            <strong>Admiral Zod</strong>,

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The unknown Fargone ship replied,

                        <p>
                            <strong>Chief of the Dar</strong>, 
                            "We don't come here to make war. We come in peace. We are the 
                            people of Navi from Pandora in Alpha Centauri. Please 
                            don’t attack."

                            <strong>Chief of the Dar</strong>, 
                            "We need help back on our planet. We have enemies that we need 
                            to fight off. Please help? I implore you to come to Pandora."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Admiral Zod</strong>, 
                            "We will in due time. Please land in our capital for food, 
                            water, and fuel. We also implore you to rest up before our 
                            journey to Pandora."

                            And thus, the Admiral commanded the ArcNet to stand down, 
                            and it did. The Pandoran Fargone ships have now safely landed 
                            on Zharian soil and are now under negotiations, possibly for

                            he enemy, whom we will denote as Nova (not in terms of Marvel, 
                            but still), has now taken control of most parts of Pandora and 
                            is mining its resources, including its valuable Fargone 
                            shipbuilding facilities. The Nova Nation comes from another 
                            planet within the same solar system as Pandora. They invaded 
                            Pandora for its resources and workforce, intending to plunder 
                            and exploit the planet for their own shipbuilding needs.

                        <p>
                            More and more ships are seen moving inbound and outbound between 
                            Nova and Pandora.

                        <p>
                            The Fargone ships are now almost complete, with a total of 
                            300 Fargone ships constructed and nearly ready for launch. 
                            The Navi and Zhare have negotiated further expansion and base-
                            building agreements, similar to the VFA agreement between the 
                            Philippines and America—only this time, between the Navi and 
                            Zhare.

                        <p>
                            Zhare has now ordered the launch of its Fargone ships into 
                            the air and space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As Zhare is now fully prepared, all Fargone ships are airborne 
                            and in space, ready to jump to Pandora.

                            As they entered Pandora's space, each of the 300 and 1 Fargone 
                            ships joined the fray.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Nova Fargone ships had secured Pandora's space and now 
                            engaged their weapons, warning the incoming Fargone ships to 
                            stay away or face destruction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the Navi Fargone ships and the Zharian Fargone ships replied,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Admiral Zod</strong>, 
                            "This is Admiral Zod of the Zharian Nation. Stand down, Nova, 
                            or we will open fire."

                            <strong>Chieftain Naiivatu</strong>, 
                            "You have taken our homes. Now we fight for it. All Navi, 
                            let us take back our homes!"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On Pandora, all Navi had been gearing up and were now fighting 
                            the Nova forces on the planet, while the Zharian and Navi Fargone 
                            ships engaged the Nova fleet in space. Weapons were fired, and 
                            the battle erupted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A Navi Fargone ship was damaged in the fight but managed to 
                            retreat. Zhare, on the other hand, not only defeated a single 
                            Nova Fargone ship but destroyed approximately 135 enemy Fargone 
                            ships in battle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the ground level, the Navi forces were fighting fiercely, 
                            with explosions erupting throughout the battlefield. The battle 
                            raged on and on until the final Nova Fargone ships fled Pandora's 
                            space, declaring,
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Nova Forces</strong>, 
                            "This is not over. We will return stronger!"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And with that, they left Pandora's space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Though the war had been won, uncertainty loomed over future 
                            invasions that might come. The Navi Fargone ships and two Zharian 
                            Fargone ships landed in Iviaana, the capital city of the Navi 
                            on Pandora.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Pandorans spoke, "Zhare, thank you for helping us. We 
                            welcome you to our planet."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Zhare</strong>, 
                            "Thank you for your hospitality. We will leave a few ships in 
                            your space so that no one will ever invade you again."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Pandora</strong>, 
                            "Thank you."</p>
                        <p>
                            Zhare boarded their ships and departed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Zharian Fargone ships also left Pandora's space, but 20 
                            Fargone ships remained behind to protect Pandora under the 
                            leadership of Admiral Karin.

                            They opened a portal and left, now heading back to Earth.

                            So thus, the Zharian got to work in building more Fargone ships 
                            and their classes.Zhare was able to build Destroyer Class, Frigate 
                            Class, Aircraft Carrier Class, Missile Carrier Class, Mobile 
                            Command and Troop Carrier Class—Fargone ships, similar to their 
                            spaceships and navy ships.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Zhare has built almost 1,000 of each of these classes in a span 
                            of six years.

                            "Engines online, let's prepare for Operation Naiita."

                            exiting them swiftly. As they entered Pandoran Space, they did 
                            not stop until they reached Nova Planet.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Nita</strong>,

                            <strong>Gregor</strong>, 
                            "At ease. Nice to see you, Nita."

                            <strong>Nita</strong>, 
                            "Yes, thank you."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Gregor</strong>, 
                            "How is our kingdom?"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Nita</strong>, 
                            "We have already arrested 14,000 dissenters across our kingdom and 
                            conducted planetary-wide arrests."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Gregor</strong>, 
                            "Good. Impose the death penalty on them as well. Let the people 
                            witness these executions so they will understand our true power."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Nita</strong>, 
                            "Understood."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Gregor</strong>, 
                            "And also, prepare rooms for our guests. They will stay in the 
                            palace."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Nita</strong>, 
                            "Understood, Your Majesty."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Zharian delegates stayed in the palace overnight, then packed 
                            up and left, leaving behind a note.
                        </p>
                        <p>Note:</p>
                        <p>
                            "Sorry, we have to leave early. Our job here is done. I left a few 
                            ships in your space for any other dissenters that may arise.

                        <p>
                            Good luck, and have a good and pleasant day ahead—I know you will 
                            need it.
                        </p>
                        <p>Also,</p>
                        <p>
                            Your transport Fargone ships are now inbound and will be arriving 
                            in 14 days.
                        </p>

                            Thank you.

                            <br>Regards,
                            <br>Zhare Delegates."
                        </p>
                        <p>King Gregor thought to himself, "This is great news."</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>King Gregor</strong>, 
                            "Let's prepare a landing zone for the inbound transport ships."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Commander Nita</strong>, 
                            "Understood."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, only a few ships remained in Nova Space—about 17 Fargone ships—
                            while the rest left the space, entered Earth's atmosphere, and 
                            landed safely in the hangar.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Zharian Fargone ships were also stationed in Earth's orbit to 
                            guard against any future threats that might arise.
                        </p>
                        <p>The King of Zhare then made another speech:</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>King James</strong>,
                            "We have successfully gained another ally in the Zhare-Pandora-Nova 
                            alliance.
                        </p>
                        <p>With this, we position ourselves as protectors of peace.</p>
                        <p>
                            We also plan to integrate Pandora and Nova into our kingdom as 
                            soon as Nova’s dissenters are subdued. Pandora will soon become 
                            part of Zhare as a kingdom.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will now send emissaries to both planets as soon as possible to 
                            grant them kingdomhood."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regards,
                            <br>King James
                            <br>Zhare
                            <br>Earth"
                        </p>
                        <p>End of Speech</p>
                        <p>
                            Now, the emissary forces were sent to Pandora and Nova for the 
                            meantime.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Zhare continued to build more Fargone ships and spaceships to 
                            enhance its fleets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, Zhare sent emissaries to Earth 2, Earth 3, and 
                            Earth 10, requesting their full integration into Earth 1. The 
                            Kingdoms of Decka, Filus, and Hans were asked to join Zhare on 
                            Earth 1, which meant leaving behind their respective Earths.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Earth 2, Earth 3, and Earth 10 accepted the request and were now 
                            undergoing a massive exodus operation.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now to Pandora:</p>
                        <p>
                            The Pandorans accepted kingdomhood under one condition—they 
                            required Zhare to protect the entire solar system from external 
                            threats. The emissary agreed to the terms, and the delegation 
                            began their journey home.
                        </p>
                        <p>Now to Nova:</p>
                        <p>
                            The Novans accepted kingdomhood but requested additional ground 
                            security to ensure stability under the leadership of King Gregor. 
                            The emissary agreed, and they too began their return home.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Meanwhile, even the kingdoms of Hassar and Dartha from Earth 45 
                            had initiated a massive exodus operation. They were leaving not 
                            only their own Earths but also the occupied territories, relocating 
                            everyone to Earth 1 under Zharian authority.

                        <p>
                            Now, with the massive exodus operations completed across the 
                            multiverse, the affected Earths—primarily Earths 2, 3, 10, 44, 
                            45, and 46—were now abandoned. Earths 44 and 46 had been 
                            conquered by Noran from Dartha on Earth 45, prompting further 
                            exodus protocols.

                        <p>
                            Zhare, on the other hand, had prepared a ballistic missile 
                            capable of inter-multiversal travel, equipped with a Deconia 
                            Bomb.

                        <p>
                            With permission granted by the leaders of Decka, Dartha, 
                            Filus, Hans, and Hassar, the Deconia Missile was authorized 
                            for launch to eradicate Earths 2, 3, 10, 44, 45, and 46 once 
                            the exodus operations had concluded.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As soon as the final departures were confirmed, Zhare prepared 
                            to launch the ballistic missile toward the now-empty Earths, 
                            ensuring their absolute destruction.

                        <p>
                            In a distant sector, possibly orbiting a red giant star, an 
                            unknown planet had emerged as a formidable superpower. 
                            This world, potentially Krypton, had begun establishing 
                            military bases, outposts, and colonies across the 
                            surrounding planets.
                        </p>
                        <p>For now, this development would remain undisturbed.</p>

                    <section class="books-content">
                        <p>
                            Now, the Exodus Operation for Earths 2, 3, and 10 was complete. 
                            Zhare launched its ballistic missile, armed with the Deconia Bomb, 
                            toward these Earths.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The missile ascended into the air and activated a portal leading 
                            to the respective Earths. Upon arrival, the Deconia Bomb 
                            detonated, completely obliterating those planets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the operation concluded, Zhare’s ArcNet reactivated, 
                            bringing its weapons and shields online, including the 
                            Plasma Railgun and Plasma Shield Array.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Suddenly, Kryptonian Fargone ships were detected inbound. 
                            Their signal was traced from Krypton, located in the far 
                            quadrant of the Milky Way Galaxy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Kryptonian fleet halted at the upper orbit of Earth, 
                            staying beyond the range of Zhare’s ArcNet Defense 
                            Satellite. However, Zharian Fargone ships, along with 
                            newly designed space-worthy fighters, quickly engaged 
                            their weapons, preparing for combat.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Kryptonians then transmitted an open-channel message:</p>

                            "I do not care. Whether you are a protector or 
                            not is irrelevant. I will initiate Protocol Terraform.

                            At that moment, another fleet entered the fray—this 
                            time from Mars.

                            <strong>Martian Fargone Fleet</strong>,
                            "This is the Martian Fargone Fleet, Nagonia.
                            <br>You have no authority in this sector of the galaxy.
                            <br>(to crew) "Engage weapons now."
                            <br>(crew) "Roger"
                            <br>Fire!

                            The Martian Fargone fleet opened fire on the Kryptonian 
                            ships, nearly destroying them. However, just as the 
                            Martians were about to fire another volley, the 
                            Kryptonian fleet swiftly retreated.
